  "summary": "Zoran Mušič (12 February 1909 – 25 May 2005), baptised as Anton Zoran Mušič, was a Slovene painter, printmaker and draughtsman from the area of the Kras Plateau near the Adriatic Sea. He was the only painter of Slovene descent who managed to establish himself in the elite cultural circles of Italy and France, particularly Paris, where he lived for the larger part of his later life. He painted landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, but also scenes of horror from the Dachau concentration camp and the vedutes of Venice.\n\n",
