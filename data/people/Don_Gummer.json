  "summary": "Don Gummer (born December 12, 1946) is an American sculptor and husband of actress Meryl Streep. His early work concentrated on table-top and wall-mounted sculpture; but, in the mid-1980s, he shifted his interest to large free-standing works, often in bronze. In the 1990s, he added a variety of other materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum and stained glass. His interest in large outdoor works also led him to an interest in public art.",
