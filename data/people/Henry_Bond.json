  "summary": "Henry Bond, FHEA (born 13 June 1966) is an English writer, photographer, and visual artist. In his Lacan at the Scene (Slavoj Žižek, series ed., Short Circuits, MIT Press, 2009), Bond made contributions to theoretical psychoanalysis and forensics.\nIn 1990, with Sarah Lucas, Bond organised the art exhibition East Country Yard Show, which was influential in the formation and development of the Young British Artists movement; together with Damien Hirst, Angela Bulloch, and Liam Gillick, the two were \"the earliest of the YBAs.\"\nBond's visual art tends to appropriation and pastiche; he has exhibited work made collaboratively with YBA artists including a photograph made with Sam Taylor-Wood and the Documents Series, made with Liam Gillick. In the 1990s, Bond was a photojournalist working for British fashion, music, and youth culture magazine The Face. In 1998, his photobook of street fashions in London The Cult of the Street was published. His Point and Shoot (Cantz, 2000), explored the photo-genres of surveillance, voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism.\nIn 2007, Bond completed his doctoral research; in 2009, he was appointed Senior Lecturer in Photography at Kingston University.",
