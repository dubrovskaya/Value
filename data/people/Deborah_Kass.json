  "summary": "Deborah Kass (born 1952) is an American artist whose work explores the intersection of pop culture, art history, and the self. Deborah Kass works in mixed media, and is most recognized for her paintings, prints, photography, sculptures and neon lighting installations. The artist mimics and reworks signature styles of iconic male artists of the 20th century including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Ed Ruscha. Kassâ€™s technique of appropriation is a critical commentary on the intersection of social power relations, personal identity, and the historically dominant position of male artists in the art world.",
