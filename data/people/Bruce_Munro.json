  "summary": "Bruce Munro (born 2 June 1959) is an English artist primarily concerned with the medium of light. He is best known for producing large immersive site-specific installations, often by massing components in the thousands. Frequently, Munro’s subject matter is his own experience of fleeting moments of rapport with the world and existence in its largest sense, of being part of life’s essential pattern. His reoccurring motif is the use of light on an environmental scale in order to create an emotional response for the viewer.\nAn artistic diarist, Munro has spent over 30 years collecting and recording ideas and images in his sketchbooks, which he returns to over time for source material. Language, literature, science, and music have also greatly influenced his work.",
