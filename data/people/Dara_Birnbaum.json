  "summary": "Dara Birnbaum (born 1946) is an American video and installation artist who lives and works in New York (USA). Birnbaum entered the nascent field of video art in the mid-to-late 1970s challenging the gendered biases of the period and televisionâ€™s ever-growing presence within the American household. Her oeuvre primarily addresses ideological and aesthetic features of mass media through the intersection of video art and television. She uses video to reconstruct television imagery using materials such as archetypal formats as quizzes, soap operas, and sports programmes. Her techniques involve the repetition of images and interruption of flow with text and music. She is also well known for forming part of the feminist art movement that emerged within video art in the mid-1970s.",
