  "summary": "Marina Abramović (Serbian Cyrillic: Марина Абрамовић, pronounced [marǐːna abrǎːmoʋitɕ]; born November 30, 1946) is a Serbian performance artist. Her work explores the relationship between performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Active for over four decades, Abramović has been described as the \"grandmother of performance art.\" She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on \"confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body.\"",
