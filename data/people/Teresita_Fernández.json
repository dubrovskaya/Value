  "summary": "Teresita Fern치ndez (born May 12, 1968) is a visual artist best known for her prominent public sculptures and unconventional use of materials. Fern치ndez's work is characterized by an interest in perception and the psychology of looking. Her experiential, large-scale works are often inspired by landscape and natural phenomena as well as diverse historical and cultural references. The artist's work has explored issues in contemporary art related to perception and the fabrication of the natural world. Often her sculptures present spectacular optical illusions and evoke natural phenomena, land formations, and water in its infinite forms.",
