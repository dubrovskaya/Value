  "summary": "Wim Delvoye (born 1965 in Wervik, West Flanders) is a Belgian neo-conceptual artist known for his inventive and often shocking projects. Much of his work is focused on the body. He repeatedly links the attractive with the repulsive, creating work that holds within it inherent contradictions â€“ one does not know whether to stare, be seduced, or to look away. As the critic Robert Enright wrote in the art magazine Border Crossings, \"Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created\". Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Brighton, UK.",
