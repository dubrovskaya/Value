  "summary": "Arman (November 17, 1928 – October 22, 2005) was a French-born American artist. Born Armand Fernandez in Nice, France, Arman was a painter who moved from using objects for the ink or paint traces they leave (\"cachet\", \"allures d'objet\") to using them as the painting itself. He is best known for his \"accumulations\" and destruction/recomposition of objects.",
