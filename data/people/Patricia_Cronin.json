  "summary": "Patricia Cronin (born in 1963 in Beverly, Massachusetts) is a New York-based cross-disciplinary artist. Since the early-1990s, Cronin has garnered international attention for her photographs, paintings and sculptures that address contemporary human rights issues. Cronin's conceptual artistic practice transits across many aesthetic platforms addressing social justice issues of gender, sexuality and class, including: lesbian visibility, feminist art history, marriage equality and international rights of women. She subverts traditional art images and forms in a wide range of two and three-dimensional time-honored artists' materials and breathes new life into these images and forms by injecting her specific political content. Slyly reinvigorating traditional images and forms with social justice themes, her critically acclaimed statue, \"Memorial To A Marriage\", a 3-ton Carrara marble mortuary sculpture of her life partner and herself was made before gay marriage was legal in the U.S., and has been exhibited widely across the country and abroad. Cronin began her career working for the Anne Frank Stichting (Foundation) in Amsterdam installing the traveling exhibition \"Anne Frank in the World\" in Europe and the U.S. Giving presence to female absence is a consistent thread that runs through and connects each body of work.",
