  "summary": "Carole A. Feuerman is an American sculptor and artist working in Hyperrealism, a movement that began in the 1970s in relation to photorealist painting. Born in 1945, Feuerman was a full generation younger than Duane Hanson and John de Andrea, the pioneers of Hyperrealism in figurative sculpture. Dubbed \"the reigning doyenne of super-realism\" by art historian John T. Spike, Feuerman achieved fame through her lifelike portrayals of swimmers.",
