  "summary": "Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger (Hebrew: ברכה אטינגר, ברכה ליכטנברג-אטינגר‎) is an Israeli-born painter. As visual artist she has mainly produced paintings, drawings, notebooks and photography. She is also a philosopher, psychoanalyst and writer.\nEttinger's work consists mostly of oil painting. Ettinger is now considered to be a prominent figure among both the French painters' and the Israeli art's scenes. Ettinger's art was recently analysed at length in the book Women Artists at the Millennium, in Griselda Pollock's Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum and in Catherine de Zegher's anthology Women's Work is Never Done. Her ideas in cultural theory, psychoanalysis, and French feminism (see Feminist theory and psychoanalysis) achieved recognition after the publication of Matrix and Metramorphosis (1992), fragments from her notebooks (Moma, Oxford, 1993) and The Matrixial Gaze (1995). Over the last two decades her work has been influential in art history, film studies (including feminist film theory), psychoanalysis, aesthetics and gender studies.\nEttinger is a Professor at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.",
