She is known for her great variety of work in video projection, photography, and spatial installations. She has worked in landscaping, design, and writing. \"I always look for experimental processes. I like the fact that at the beginning I don't know how to do things and then, slowly, I start learning. Often exhibitions don't give me this learning possibility anymore.\"",
